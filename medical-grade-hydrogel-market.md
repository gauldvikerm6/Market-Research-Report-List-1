<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Grade Hydrogel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crosslinking Agent Crosslinking</li><li>Physical Crosslinking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical-grade hydrogel market is categorized mainly into two types based on the crosslinking methods: chemical crosslinking and physical crosslinking. Chemical crosslinking involves covalent bonds formed by incorporating a crosslinking agent, resulting in stable, long-lasting structures suitable for applications like drug delivery and wound healing. In contrast, physical crosslinking relies on non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions, allowing for reversible gel structures. This category is often used in applications requiring flexibility and absorbency.</p></p>
