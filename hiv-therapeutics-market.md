<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HIV Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nucleoside-Analog Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs)</li><li>Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs)</li><li>Entry and Fusion Inhibitors</li><li>Protease Inhibitors (PIs)</li><li>Integrase Inhibitors</li><li>Coreceptor Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The HIV therapeutics market comprises various classes of antiviral drugs aimed at inhibiting the virus's lifecycle. NRTIs block reverse transcriptase, preventing viral replication. NNRTIs also target reverse transcriptase but through a different mechanism. Entry and fusion inhibitors prevent HIV from entering host cells, while protease inhibitors disrupt protein processing essential for viral assembly. Integrase inhibitors block the integration of viral DNA into the host genome, and coreceptor antagonists impede the virus's ability to attach to immune cells, enhancing treatment options.</p></p>
