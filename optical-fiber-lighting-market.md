<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Fiber Lighting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>End-emitting Fiber</li><li>Edge-emitting Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The optical fiber lighting market primarily consists of two types: end-emitting fiber and edge-emitting fiber. End-emitting fiber allows light to exit directly from the ends of the fiber, creating focused, bright points of illumination ideal for applications like decorative lighting and signage. In contrast, edge-emitting fiber emits light along its length, producing a more uniform glow, suitable for accent lighting and artistic installations. Both types leverage the unique advantages of optical fibers to deliver efficient, versatile lighting solutions.</p></p>
